# CodeHawks FirstFlight: Soulmate üöÄüöÄ

Methodology used here is **GTDA** from _Guardian Audits - Owen Thrum_

## GOALS

### Understand Protocol From Docs

**Overview**

Mint a shared Soulbound NFT with an unknown person, and get rewarded `LoveToken` for staying with your soulmate.

**Soulmate.sol**

A Soulbound NFT is generated here which can be shared by soulmates, and used in the protocol.

- `mintSoulmateToken`: you mint a Soulbound NFT. Get assigned to someone waiting for a soulmate, or you'll wait till you get assigned a soulmate.
- `soulMateOf`: returns the soulmate of an address. `address(0)` if none.
- `writeMessageInSharedSpace`: write messages to your soulmate.
- `getDivorced`: üè≥Ô∏è should assign paired soulmates addresses to `address(0)`. üè≥Ô∏è Only paired soulmates can collect LoveToken from the airdrop. üè≥Ô∏è Getting divorced should be permanent.

**LoveToken.sol**

A basic ERC20 token minted to soulmates.

Initial supply get distributed to 2 instances of `Vault.sol` and managed by `Airdrop.sol` and `Staking.sol`.

**Airdrop.sol**

Only soulmates can claim 1 LoveToken in 24 hours.

- `claim`: allows soulmates to collect 1 LoveToken independently per day.

**Staking.sol**

Allows for the staking of claimed LoveTokens to claim even more!

- `deposit`: deposit LoveToken to the staking contract
- `withdraw`: withdraw LoveToken from the staking contract
- `claimRewards`: claim LoveToken rewards from the staking contract.

LoveToken Earning Mechanism:

1 LoveToken staked (deposited) for 1 week = 1 LoveToken reward

**Vault.sol**

Responsible for holding the LoveTokens, and approving the Staking contract and Airdrop contract to pull funds from the Vaults.

### Understand Protocol from Code

**Conventions**

- SM: SoulMate.

#### `Soulmate:mintSoulmateToken`

- When second person unites with second person, an NFT is minted to that person. Why is no NFT minted to other soulmate?

**Answer**

The first SM address is mapped to `nextID` in the mapping `ownerToId` within the `if (soulmate == address(0)) { ... }` block

## Common AttackVectors

### For a Staking based protocol

- A malicious miner can frontrun attack when he sees a `distributeReward` function call to reward users that have held `xTokens` for a while. The malicious miner can stake X tokens for less amount of time and get rewarded same amount for users that staked for a longer time.
